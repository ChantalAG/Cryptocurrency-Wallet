## Background
Fintech Finder is an application that its customers can use to find fintech professionals from among a list of candidates, hire them, and pay them. As Fintech Finder’s lead developer, you have been tasked with integrating the Ethereum blockchain network into the application in order to enable your customers to instantly pay the fintech professionals whom they hire with cryptocurrency.
In this Challenge, you will complete the code that enables your customers to send cryptocurrency payments to fintech professionals. To develop the code and test it out, you will assume the perspective of a Fintech Finder customer who is using the application to find a fintech professional and pay them for their work.

To complete this Challenge, two files will be used. 
The first file is called [fintech_finder.py](). It contains the code associated with the web interface of the application. The code included in this file is compatible with the Streamlit library. 
The second file is called [crypto_wallet.py](https://github.com/ChantalAG/Cryptocurrency-Wallet/blob/main/crypto_wallet.py). This file contains the Ethereum transaction functions that has been created throughout this module. By using import statements, the crypto_wallet.py Python script will be integrated into the Fintech Finder interface program that is found in the fintech_finder.py file.
Integrating these two files will allow you to automate the tasks associated with generating a digital wallet, accessing Ethereum account balances, and signing and sending transactions via a personal Ethereum blockchain called Ganache.

Specifically, you will assume the perspective of a Fintech Finder customer in order to do the following:


* Generate a new Ethereum account instance by using the mnemonic seed phrase provided by Ganache.


* Fetch and display the account balance associated with your Ethereum account address.


* Calculate the total value of an Ethereum transaction, including the gas estimate, that pays a Fintech Finder candidate for their work.


* Digitally sign a transaction that pays a Fintech Finder candidate, and send this transaction to the Ganache blockchain.


* Review the transaction hash code associated with the validated blockchain transaction.


Once you receive the transaction’s hash code, you will navigate to the Transactions section of Ganache to review the blockchain transaction details. To confirm that you have successfully created the transaction, you will save and display screenshots.
